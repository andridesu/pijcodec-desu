# PIJ Codec

## Overview
PIJ (short for "PNG inside JPEG") is a codec that enables embedding lossless regions of a PNG image within a lossy JPEG image. This is useful for applications that require preserving the quality of specific regions while benefiting from JPEG compressionâ€”such as face region encryption or scenarios where certain parts of the image need to remain lossless.
